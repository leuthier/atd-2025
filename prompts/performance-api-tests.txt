Goal:
Implement performance API test automation for POST /checkout.

Context:
- The API spec for POST /checkout is on the swagger.yaml file
- There are already functional API test automation for POST /checkout under the folder test.
- README.md file already has data about registered users.

Rules:
- Create test cases for the main flow of each operation, only performance tests
- Use Javascript and K6 (K6 is already installed)
- Tests should be placed under the folder with the same name of the endpoint under the foder k6
- Use fixtures and isolate the test data.
- Create a helper function to login and get the JWT token.
