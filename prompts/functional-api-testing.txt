Goal:
Implement functional API test automation for POST /checkout.

Context:
- The API spec for POST /checkout is on the swagger.yaml file
- Rules for the Checkout are into the Jira Ticket ATD-12 under juliodelima.atlassian.net 
- README.md file already has data about registered users and products.

Rules:
- Create test cases for the main flow of each operation, only functional tests
- Use Javascript, Mocha, Supertest and Chai
- Tests should be placed under the folder with the same name of the endpoint under the foder test
- Use fixtures and isolate the test data.
- Create a helper function to login and get the JWT token.
